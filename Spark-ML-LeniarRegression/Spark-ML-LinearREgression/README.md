# Spark ML Examples

This repository contains two examples of Spark ML projects: Linear Regression and K-Means Clustering.

## Linear Regression

### Overview

The Linear Regression example demonstrates how to use Spark MLlib to build a simple linear regression model for predicting sales based on advertising spending on TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java
- Apache Spark
- Maven (if building the project)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
2. Download the advertising.csv dataset and place it in the project directory.
3. Run the LR class to train the linear regression model:
